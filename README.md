Section Title:
More Than Coffee

Body Copy:
We’re a neighborhood café built for people who don’t rush their coffee.
Every bean we brew has a story — from the farmers who grow it, to the roast profile that brings it to life, to the hands that carefully prepare your cup.

We believe coffee should be intentional, honest, and unforgettable.
No shortcuts. No burnt beans. Just thoughtful brewing, warm spaces, and meaningful conversations.

Highlight Line:
Coffee is our craft. Community is our heart.
